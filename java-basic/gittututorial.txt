mkdir = make a new folder 

cd = get acess tht folder

touch = is to add something to tht folder (ex: touch indexx.html app.css)

git init = this is like when you put a memory card in ur pc 

git add . = save all (95% U USE THISS!!!!!!!!!) mini save point

or 

git add index.html = save a specific something. mini save point    

git commit = thi is the full save 

but a more right ways is 

git commit -m "discribe what you change or did" - full save with name. 

 rm = is delete a file. 

 clear = clear the terminal. 

 git log = let's us see all our saves.

 git checkout (name of the file or branch or previus branch) 
ex: (git checkout main)

now how to put your code to github. 

1. u make a github acc 

2. u make a repo (a file in Github)

3.if u don't have a file yet THEN MAKE ONE !! 
if ur good and u listend to me put this into your new file.

4.a git remote add origin https://github.com/.... = this a command to hook up ur local file to the website. 

OR THIS : 

4.b echo "# gitVideo" >> README.dashboard

5.b git init 

6.b add REAME.md 

7.b git commit -m "first commit"

8.b git branch -M main

9.b git remote add origin https://github.com/....

10b git push -u orinin main 

NOW GETTING BACK AT IT.. 

4. git push -u (name of the branch u want to push in) = u push ur things to the internet AKA to github.

NOW BRANCHES
branches are made so that u dont duck up the main one where u only live the best clean code u have 
then u put the experiments the garbage in ur branch.
clean it up then when its ultra clean and fresh its worthy to be put in the main branch.



5. checkout -b (name of the new branch u want to make.) = this is how u make new branches 

6. git branch = let's you check all the branch u have. 

7. ls = lets you check all of the files u have in that branch. 

8. push origin (name of the branch) = this lets you push a branch to Github. 

9. git pull origin (name of the branch) = this lets you get an updated version of that github file in your 
    local computer. 

    ex: git pull origin main 

10.
